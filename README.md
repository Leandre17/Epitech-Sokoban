# __SOKOBAN__ <br/>
> Sokoban (warehouse keeper in Japanese) is a type of transport puzzle, in which
> the player pushes boxes or crates around in a warehouse, trying to get them to
> storage locations. The puzzle is usually implemented as a video game.
> Sokoban was created in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and published in 1982 by
> Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in Takarazuka, Japan.
> The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor or
> a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares are marked as
> storage locations. The player is confined to the board, and may move
> horizontally or vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes).
> The player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square beyond.
> Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they cannot be pulled.
> The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage locations.
